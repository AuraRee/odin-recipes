<h2>Description</h2>
Mochi (pronounced "MOE-chee") are small, sweet Japanese cakes made with glutinous rice flour (mochiko). 

<p>They have a soft, chewy outer layer and a deliciously sticky filling made of sweetened red bean paste - it's somewhat elastic. Mochi is often flavored with matcha (or green tea powder), which gives it a light green hue. Freezing the red bean paste before you use it is optional but it does make the process easier.
