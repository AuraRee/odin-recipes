<h2>Description</h2>
A soul-warming and deliciously simple homemade chicken noodle soup — just chicken and noodles.

<p>This is the simplest and best-tasting chicken soup, and you'll loves it! This is just plain comfort food. It all comes together so quickly too. I added small chunks of potato just because that's what we're used to. </p>
<p>What makes it so good is the homemade roasted chicken stock. It also works to make the broth and soup with some leftover Thanksgiving turkey. And it's key to also remember that your soup will only be as good as your broth / stock. <br>Enjoy!</p>
