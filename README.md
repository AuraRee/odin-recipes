Project: Recipe
I am going to construct a basic recipe website.

By creating this website I will be displaying my extensive knowledge of web development and the skills I hone of HTML and my deep understanding of it's operations.

Self-Reflection:
I managed to handle the project quite well. I didn't find it all so difficult as I had prior knowledge of HTML, so the process when by with no hiccups.
More importantly I got to learnt how to use the primary git commands (staging files, committing, pushing them onto GitHub remote repository) more efficiently through the CLI - Visual Studios terminal.
All-in-all I enjoyed it and I am fully motivated to move to the next lesson and learn more.
